# GoalsDaily
My first Swift 5 iOS App that I made in 2 days without sleep. Personal trainer in the palm of your hands managing daily fitness goals that it creates for you (or by yourself) and motivating you with quotes.

iOS version: 13.2 and up

## Description
It is never easy to think of goals for yourself and stick to them. These days we find ourselves not getting enough exercise, eating the wrong type of food, skipping breakfast... the list goes on and on. Especially as 2019 is coming to an end, (this was written on Christmas Eve), we will once again start setting unrealistic new year resolutions that we will probably never come close to accomplishing as our motivations slowly evaporate away.

Thankfully, with GoalsDaily, you will no longer have to worry about any of that!

## Features
Select a category (random, exercise, nutrition, challenge) and generate a randomized fitness goal! If you are satisfied with it, press save to add it to your list of daily fitness challenges! Of course, you can even type in goals yourself.

Easily slide left on an added fitness goal tab to find the delete button that removes it off of your list.
... or press the reset button on the very bottom to clear your entire taskboard and start over.

Implementation of DateTime to display today's date!

Swipe left every time to change to a screen with awesome dynamic background images of world-class athletes and randomized quotes that will certainly motivate you throughout the day and as you finish your challenges.

### Comments
This project, although it is not the most sophisticated app ever created, helped me open my eyes to the user-friendliness of XCode's interface and become well familiar with Swift, which was not too difficult because it is so similar to Java and Python. I spent 2 days without sleeping building, experimenting, and debugging this application, and although it was quite time-consuming, I thoroughly enjoyed this experience not just because of how much I got out of it academically but also because I learned about how simple it is to access really cool data and properties such as the HealthKit library and all the drag-and-drop GUIs'. When I get time, I am looking forward to creating many more apps and learning even more about the potentials of Swift.
