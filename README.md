## Description
Create goals and stick to them. Generates random daily changes and manages your goals.

## Features
Select a category (random, exercise, nutrition, challenge) and generate a randomized fitness goal. If you are satisfied with it, press save to add it to your list of daily fitness challenges. You can type your own goal into the list.

Easily slide left on an added fitness goal tab to find the delete button that removes it off of your list.
... or press the reset button on the very bottom to clear your entire taskboard and start over.

Implementation of DateTime to display today's date.

Swipe left every time to change to a screen with dynamic background images of athletes and randomized motivational quotes.
